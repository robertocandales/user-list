## State Management Design Patterns

For managing state in a medium-large application, I would use the **Redux** pattern for predictable state management, combined with **Context API** for simpler state needs and prop drilling elimination. For side effects and asynchronous logic, **React Query** can be utilized.

## Experience with Mobile Hardware in React Native

I have extensive experience using mobile hardware features in React Native applications. This includes:

- Integrating the **Camera** using libraries like `react-native-camera` and `expo-camera`.
- Handling **Storage** with `AsyncStorage` and `react-native-fs` for file system operations.
- Working with **Barcode scanning** and other sensors using Expo modules.

Although I don't have experience with **Bluetooth** integration, I am confident in my ability to quickly learn and implement it as needed.

## Experience Publishing Applications on Different Platforms

I have published applications on both the **Apple App Store** and **Google Play Store**. The process involves:

- Preparing the app with platform-specific requirements.
- Generating appropriate certificates and provisioning profiles for iOS.
- Creating a keystore for Android.
- Using tools like **Expo**, **Fastlane**, and **Xcode** for seamless deployment and continuous delivery.

I also have experience using **Expo Application Services (EAS)** for building and publishing apps, which streamlines the process significantly.
